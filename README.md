# Netflix-Clone

![DemoGif](flixdemo.gif)

A Netflix clone I created for the sake of practicing React and Redux. It features design 
patterns recommended by the documentation. Some of the tools used include: <br />

* Hooks (and custom hooks)
* React Router
* Redux Toolkit 
* Context API 
* Responsive web design 
* Cypress end-to-end testing
